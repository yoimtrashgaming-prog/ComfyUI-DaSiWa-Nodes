![MiniMax H3 Director](assets/DaSiWa-MiniMaxH3-Director-RefMod.png)

- 🎥 **Modes:** FL2VA (T2VA/I2VA/L2VA, 2 image slots), IMAGE INPAINT (1 image → single frame via 5-frame pass), REF2VA (9 img / 3 vid / 3 audio = 12 total; V/A/V+A switch per video)
- 📸 **REFMOD references:** saved image/video/audio RefMods and upstream v5 bundles from `models/refmods/` — overlay selector, strength scaling, workflow-local descriptions, `<RefMod N>` stable aliases resolved at runtime to native reference labels.
- 🔀 **Reference handling:** drag-reorder between slots, external soundtracks per video, visual crop via draggable markers, incompatible media preserved on mode toggle
- 📋 **Paste & upload:** lane selection + Ctrl+V paste into chosen lane, drag-and-drop from file manager, paste-replace onto selected tile
- ✍️ **Prompt editor:** one free-text field per mode, with optional structure, shot/RefMod insertion, and reference-label prefill; legacy prompts migrate into the same field.
- ✨ **Prompt Forge:** write H3 prompts from an idea and timeline references with a local ComfyUI LLM, Ollama, or a configured OpenAI-compatible server; review before applying and keep three drafts per Director node.
- 📐 **Resolution panel:** Aspect/Resolution/Input Scaling selectors (all default Auto) on 32px grid; grouped dropdowns; CUSTOM values; Torch Resize preprocessing (Off/Auto/Target/Fit/Fill/Fit+pad/Divisible crop)
- 💾 **Save/Load packs:** reference files + prompt + RefMod selections persisted independently; append or overwrite with limit validation and missing-file checks
- 🎬 **Video thumbnails:** first-frame preview behind each video clip tile
- ⏱️ **Crop preview:** ▶ Play crop button, draggable preview range
- 🔒 **Validated limits:** 2–15s reference windows, 15s max combined visual/audio duration, path-safety under ComfyUI input directory
- 🧩 **Native routing & lazy loading:** hands validated data to built-in MiniMaxH3 nodes; only selected model requested; REF2VA binds native inputs by name for Core-order compatibility
- ⚙️ **External overwrite inputs:** `external_prompt_overwrite` (STRING), `external_width_overwrite` + `external_height_overwrite` (INT) bypass Director canvas sizing
- 🎞️ **Frame rate:** FLOAT input (0.1–240, default 24) with matching output for downstream nodes
- 🔨 **Forge:** writes the prompt with a local LLM (Ollama, a model in `models/llm`, or llama.cpp / any OpenAI-compatible server), fills the builder fields, then unloads the model so H3 gets the whole GPU. Easiest setup: install Ollama and `ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b-instruct`. [Forge guide →](docs/minimax_h3_forge.md)

### ⚡ MiniMax H3 Cache

An approximate, model-scoped whole-block-stack residual cache for ComfyUI's native MiniMax H3 model.

- **MODEL PATCH:** clones only the connected MiniMax H3 `MODEL`; no global model-class monkey patch.
- **CONTROLLED REUSE:** sampled audio/video-token relative-L1 threshold, 15–90% sampling window, and a bounded number of consecutive cache hits.
- **STORAGE:** auto / CUDA / CPU cached-residual storage with CPU fallback if automatic storage runs out of VRAM.
- **COMPATIBILITY:** preserves ComfyUI block replacements and transformer options; can be chained with **Patch Comfy Kitchen Attention**.
- **PDD HEAD BANK:** works with ComfyUI's PDD LoRA head bank (0.34+). The node passes the PDD sigma-schedule arguments automatically, so cache and PDD coexist with no extra setup.
- **PER-TOKEN MASKS:** honors per-token video and audio denoise masks, running masked rows at their own strength exactly like Core, so cached and region-masked generations match Core quality.
- **QUALITY:** approximate optimization—higher cache thresholds trade fidelity for more skipped block-stack evaluations.

### 🔥 Patch Comfy Kitchen Attention

A one-input model patch that swaps the connected model's attention backend to Comfy Kitchen INT8 attention at runtime.

- **Model-scoped:** clones only the connected `MODEL` and sets its optimized-attention override; it never monkey-patches ComfyUI globally.
- **Safe fallback:** if Comfy Kitchen INT8 attention is unavailable in your ComfyUI build, it falls back to the ComfyUI default attention and logs the decision.
- **Chainable:** works before or after **MiniMax H3 Cache** — both are model-clone patches and compose in either order.

### 💎 RTX Upscaler & Refiner

State-of-the-art image and video enhancement using NVIDIA RTX Video SDK. It executes up to three sequential passes (Denoise, Deblur, and Upscale) in a single node, processing frame-by-frame to keep VRAM usage predictable and low.

- **Refine:** Independent Denoise and Deblur passes (both off by default).
- **Upscale:** AI-powered VSR and High Bitrate upscaling.
- **Smart Sizing:** Multiple resize modes including Constant Megapixel targets.
- **Efficiency:** Frame-by-frame processing for minimal VRAM usage.
- **Memory Control:** The output batch is allocated lazily (like the reference NVIDIA node — the kernel decides, no up-front memory pressure, no temp file). A disk-backed (mmap) fallback (`use_mmap`, off by default) is opt-in for very long video batches: when enabled it is the last tier of the VRAM -> RAM -> disk chain, taken only when available RAM is still short after automatic model unloading (`auto_unload_models`, on by default). **Warning:** enabling `use_mmap` writes a multi-giB `.mmap` temp file to your temp drive for the whole run.

### 📐 Resolution Scale Calculator

The **DaSiWa Scale Calculator** provides mathematically precise resolution management for high-performance video models. It uses a **Constant-Area Square-Root method** to ensure that your GPU VRAM usage remains stable regardless of the aspect ratio.

- **Unified Resolution Presets:** Pick standard `p` targets from 144p to 2160p/4K or optimized megapixel tiers from one dropdown.
- **Clear Aspect Modes:** `IMAGE ASPECT` uses the connected image shape; `USE ASPECT BELOW` uses the always-visible aspect controls.
- **Video-Safe Snapping:** Standard, Div32, Div64, and custom divisor modes keep dimensions aligned for different model families.

### ⚡ Torch Resize

A drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's built-in resize nodes that keeps images sharp and video workflows fast without extra dependencies.

- **Sharper results:** Lanczos resampling with optional sRGB-to-linear gamma correction produces cleaner upscaling and downscaling than native bilinear/bicubic.
- **Video-friendly batching:** Automatically splits long frame sequences into memory-safe chunks so you never run out of VRAM, while keeping output order intact.
- **Zero extra installs:** Runs entirely on the PyTorch build ComfyUI already uses — no Pillow, torchlanc, Triton, or vendor SDK required.
- **Precise sizing control:** Divisible-by alignment, five aspect modes (fit, fill/crop, pad, stretch, long-side crop), and configurable crop/pad placement eliminate guesswork for downstream model constraints.
- **Alpha preserved:** Transparency channels are resized independently without gamma conversion artifacts.

### 🎛️ Node Status Switch

The **DaSiWa Node Status Switch** lets you mute or bypass any node in your workflow using a single toggle. Targets are registered by wiring their outputs into the switch's input slots, which grow dynamically as you connect more nodes (up to 99).

![NodeStatusSwitch.png](assets/NodeStatusSwitch.png)

[Full documentation →](docs/node_status_switch.md)

**Quick start:**

1. Add a **DaSiWa Node Status Switch** to your workflow
2. Drag any **output** from the node(s) you want to control into the switch's `target_01` input — new slots appear as you connect more
3. Set `action` to `mute` or `bypass` and configure `trigger_on` to taste
4. Toggle `enabled` directly on the switch

### 🎬 Advanced LoRA Loader

The **Advanced LoRA Loader** is a 10-slot stacker for ordinary image/video LoRAs and LTX-2.3. In **Basic mode**, it loads the complete LoRA map, so it is compatible with standard image and video models. Its `VIS` control means **visual strength**: it affects the whole LoRA map in Basic mode, including image models. LTX-2.3 additionally supports independent audio separation.

- **Model Modes:** Select Basic for universal image/video compatibility or LTX-2.3 for separate visual/audio branches. MiniMax H3 uses Basic mode because its transformer blocks are shared between video and audio.
- **Visual Control:** `STR × VIS` is the effective visual strength. In Basic mode, `VIS` controls the complete LoRA map; it is not video-only.
- **Dual-Branch Control:** LTX-2.3 can adjust visual (`VIS×`) and audio (`A×`) multipliers independently per LoRA.
- **10 LoRA Slots:** Stack up to 10 LoRAs with fine-grained strength control (STR: −5.0 to +5.0).
- **Toggle All:** The `ALL` header button enables every slot; when all slots are enabled, it disables every slot.
- **Key Count Indicator:** Auto-scans each LoRA to show video/audio key counts before generation.
- **6 Themes:** Switch between Jade, Neon, Studio, Chrome, OLED, and Wood color schemes.
- **Searchable UI:** Quick LoRA search with live filtering in the node itself.
- **LoRA Info Button (ⓘ):** an info button at the right edge of each slot row (drawn as a circle with an "i") opens an info panel with the LoRA's Civitai links — looked up by the file's SHA-256 and cached in `lorainfo/` — shown as both mirrors, `.com` (labeled `BLUE:` in blue) and `.red` (labeled `RED:` in red); the lookup falls back to the `.red` mirror when `.com` has no entry, and misses are memoized so a missing LoRA doesn't re-hit the API on every open (**Refresh** forces a re-lookup). The panel also lists trigger/trained words from the safetensors header and Civitai (click-select, copy) and preview images (Civitai plus a local sidecar image next to the LoRA if present). The file name and sha256 sit on their own rows at the top, so long folder paths can't stretch the controls (v0.4.35).
- **Trash Button (v0.4.29):** a small ASCII-drawn trash button sits directly right of the info button. It resets that slot's LoRA back to **None** (STR / V× / A× kept — same as picking None in the picker) so you can unstack a LoRA without reopening the picker. The info button shifted slightly left to make room.
- **PDD/ACC Metadata (v0.4.27):** LoRA files are read with their metadata and it is forwarded to Core's `load_lora_for_models` like the native `LoraLoader`, so PDD/ACC head banks activate; older ComfyUI builds fall back automatically.
- **Opt-in LoRA Cache (v0.4.27):** a cache button in the control strip keeps each unique LoRA file in a small LRU cache so a LoRA reused across slots is read once — **off by default**.

### 💾 Metadata Image Saver (Civitai Ready)

The **DaSiWa Metadata Image Saver** ensures your images are fully compatible with Civitai, Hugging Face, and other galleries by embedding A1111-style metadata. It automatically detects LoRAs used in the workflow and supports dynamic filenames.

- **Civitai Compatibility:** Writes the standard `parameters` block for auto-parsing of prompts and resources.
- **LoRA Detection:** Scans your workflow and appends `<lora:name:weight>` triggers automatically.
- **WebP Support:** Full "Drag-and-Drop" workflow reconstruction support for both PNG and WebP formats.
- **Dynamic Filenames:** Use placeholders like `%seed%`, `%date%`, `%model%`, `%width%`, and `%height%`.
- **Privacy:** Toggle workflow JSON embedding to share images without exposing your full graph.

### 🎞️ Enhanced Video Combine

Converts an `IMAGE` batch into a high-quality video with optional `AUDIO` muxing and an in-node VHS-style preview.

![DaSiWa Enhanced Video Combine](assets/DaSiWa-Enhanced-Video-Combine.png)

- **Codecs:** Auto (AV1 → VP9 → H.264), or explicit AV1 / VP9 / H.264 / H.265(HEVC). Hardware-first encoder chain (NVENC → QSV → AMF → VAAPI → software); mandatory H.264/MP4 fallback.
- **PyAV-native encoding (v0.4.40):** Encoding, audio muxing, metadata, animated outputs, and preview transcoding run through PyAV 18 and its bundled FFmpeg libraries without launching external processes. Hardware encoders are tried first and failed or unavailable devices fall back to software encoders.
- **Seekable previews (v0.4.40):** Every generated video receives one-second keyframes. MP4 outputs use fast-start metadata. AV1, VP9, HEVC, 10-bit, and other compatibility previews are cached as ordinary H.264/AAC files served with HTTP byte-range support, so browsers can pause and scrub reliably. Downloads remain the unchanged original codec/container.
- **Containers:** Auto-selects per codec (WebM/MKV/MP4 for AV1/VP9; MP4/MKV for H.264/H.265).
- **Animated images:** Animated AVIF (GPU AV1 or software) and Animated WebP (`libwebp_anim`). Looping, no audio.
- **Bit depth & quality:** Auto-detects 8-bit vs 10-bit source precision; Auto codec forces 8-bit 4:2:0. CRF/CQ-based quality slider (default 20).
- **Audio muxing:** Opus/AAC/MP3 selectable; Auto uses Opus (WebM) or AAC (MKV/MP4). Bitrates 64–320k. Optional crop-to-audio.
- **In-node preview:** Framed player with native hover-reveal controls and hover-to-unmute audio; an optional Mute checkbox keeps the preview permanently silent, and both Autoplay and Mute are remembered with the node. Streamed H.264 transcoding for AV1/H.265 where needed.
- **Frame exports:** Save first/last frame as PNG alongside the video; all assets published to ComfyUI Assets.
- **Ping-pong mode:** Forward/reverse frame loop.
- **Workflow metadata:** Embed prompt/workflow JSON where supported.
- **Output naming (v0.4.45):** Connect a seed to the optional `seed` socket and use `%seed%` in `filename_prefix` (for example `video/%date:yyyy-MM-dd%/shot_%seed%`) to include the exact generation seed in the video and first/last-frame export names.
- **Logging:** Compact CLI output with codec/container/encoder decisions and resolved audio settings. Built-in `?` help dialog.

### 🎬 Watermark Overlay

A professional-grade watermark tool optimized for image and video batches. It uses a stable CPU compositor with high-quality resampling and precise rotation.

- **Dynamic Random Positioning:** Toggle seeded corner cycling while keeping the selected position as the start position.
- **Splash Mode:** Configure dynamic fade-in and fade-out at the start and end of clips for professional branding.
- **Optical Padding:** Automatically adjusts placement by the watermark's visual center of mass for perfect alignment.
- **Stable Compositing:** Output frames are initialized from the source batch before the watermark region is blended, avoiding flicker and black-frame artifacts.

### 🩹 Inpaint Crop Prep & Composite

A two-node crop-inpaint-composite pair for any inpainting model. **Inpaint Crop Prep** tight-crops to the mask and scales it for a high-res inpainter; **Inpaint Composite** blends the result back onto the original image.

- **Crop Prep:** Gaussian-blurs the mask, extracts its bounding box (with configurable `grow_px` padding), crops image + mask, and bicubic-scales both to `target_width` × `target_height`. Emits `cropped_image`, `cropped_mask`, and the original-space `bbox_x/y/w/h` so you can composite back. `can_shrink` (default on) allows downscaling; turn it off to keep the crop at least its native size.
- **Composite:** pastes the inpainted `source` patch back at `(x, y)` with the (auto-rescaled) mask, applying optional **Match Channels** or **Histogram** color correction against the destination region for a seamless blend.
- **Pure PyTorch:** separable Gaussian blur, bicubic resampling, and channel-statistics color matching with no torchvision or extra dependencies.

Wiring:

```text
IMAGE + MASK ──► Inpaint Crop Prep ──► (cropped_image, cropped_mask)
                                     ──► any inpainter ──► source patch

### 🖥️ System Monitor

A compact system telemetry bar integrated directly into the ComfyUI top toolbar. The adjacent DaSiWa settings button lets you hide the monitor or choose its display mode.

- **Multi-GPU Support:** Separate metrics per GPU device (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) labeled as GPU0, GPU1, etc.
- **Resource Metrics:** CPU, RAM, SWAP/Pagefile, DISK, GPU Utilization, GPU VRAM, and GPU Temperature.
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded borders and proportional background fills (0–100%) for instant at-a-glance assessment.
- **Lite / Full Modes:** Lite is the default compact toolbar view; Full shows every available metric with detailed values and a live 60-second graph.
- **Responsive Layout:** Lite automatically hides lower-priority metrics when toolbar space is limited; Full is a scrollable panel that adapts to narrow screens. Each Lite chip sizes to its label and value (`max-content`) so text never clips, at any resolution, font, or DPI.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux and Windows with automatic fallback detection for GPU tools.
- **Container-safe:** In containers and sandboxes where parts of `/proc` are missing (e.g. `/proc/vmstat`), probes degrade to `n/a` instead of warning every second. Set `DASWA_SYSTEM_MONITOR=0` (also `false`/`no`/`off`/`disable`) to fully stop the backend polling thread.
- **Independent Placement:** Renders as its own toolbar element, not dependent on third-party extensions.
- **Free Memory Button:** Separate DaSiWa-logo toolbar button beside the top-docked monitor (or in the toolbar when the monitor is off). Free VRAM unloads ComfyUI models; Free System RAM also resets its execution cache. Hide the button independently under **Settings → Other → DaSiWa → Free Memory**.

### 🔀 Random String Picker

Bridge any string/text node through **DaSiWa Random String Picker** to randomize prompt variants inline.

- **Text passthrough:** Accepts a connected `STRING` input and returns a `STRING` output.
- **Inline variants:** Replaces every `{A|B|C}` segment with one randomly selected option.
- **Multiple groups:** Processes any number of groups independently, such as `{red|blue} car in {sun|rain}`.
- **Literal passthrough:** Text outside complete `{...}` groups is left unchanged.

### 🎯 Seed Control

**Seed Control** extracts the MiniMax H3 Director's seed panel into a standalone node — the same seed UX for any workflow, without a Director in the graph.

- **Full 64-bit seeds:** unsigned `0..0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` seed field, matching the H3 seed space.
- **Random|Fixed switch:** one segmented switch (a single control, Pixaroma style) — Random rolls a fresh seed on every queue, Fixed keeps the current seed for repeatable results; **New** rolls a fresh seed and keeps the selected mode, **Use Last** restores the previous seed and flips to Fixed. Stepping, typing, and the switch all lock the seed as Fixed.
- **Stacked layout:** seed field with an attached ▲/▼ spinner (Pixaroma seed control style; hold to repeat, wraps at the 64-bit bounds) on its own row, then the Random|Fixed switch + New, then Use Last / Last 10 seeds. The panel column has a fixed width (~240 px) and every row is the same 42 px cell height, so resizing the node never stretches or reflows the fields. The seed number auto-fits its font (shrinks as needed) so a full 16-digit seed always displays without clipping.
- **Lossless 64-bit seeds:** the panel keeps the seed as a decimal string and only *mirrors* it into the hidden INT widget (which coerces 16-digit values to a lossy JS number), so the spinner and display never desync at the top of the 64-bit range.
- **Last 10 seeds:** collapsible history with per-entry copy actions.
- **External override socket:** linking `seed` disables the local controls (showing an "External seed connected" note) and passes the connected value through — same semantics as the Director's external seed input.
- **Downstream NOISE output:** the `seed` INT and a `NOISE`-compatible object are emitted, so the value can be passed straight to any node that accepts a `NOISE` input (e.g. the LTX sampler's `noise` socket).
- **Headless-safe:** in Random mode without a local value the backend rolls a fresh seed on every queue, so API clients get the same behaviour without the DOM panel.
- **Persists with the workflow:** mode, last seed and history live in a hidden state widget and survive save/reload.

### 🎲 Wildcard & Preset Prompt Builder

**DaSiWa Wildcard & Preset Prompt Builder** builds positive and negative `STRING` prompts directly from the bundled dual wildcard library—no downstream picker node needed.

![DaSiWa Wildcard & Preset Prompt Builder](assets/DaSiWa_Wildcard_Preset_Prompt_Builder.png)

- **Dual style:** Switch globally between Booru and Natural Language source keys.
- **Compact selector:** Collapsible categories expose subject checkboxes, weights, deterministic live selections, and right-aligned selected-subject counters that remain visible while a category is collapsed.
- **Fast inspiration:** **Random Select** replaces the current selection with 1–10 secure-random available Preset/Wildcard subjects.
- **Reproducible rerolls:** Seed plus the stored reroll value reproduce every `{A|B|C}` choice; **New Picks** only advances the reroll value, while **New picks on every queue** opts into fresh output for each queue—including Preview as Text selected-output execution.
- **Weighted, bounded prompts:** Non-1.0 enabled subjects use ComfyUI emphasis syntax. Each positive/negative prompt independently removes complete lowest-weight subjects until it meets the token budget.
- **Optional prompt prefixes:** Connect `positive_input` or `negative_input` to prepend an existing prompt to that generated side.
- **Custom library:** Edit or replace `data/wildcards_and_presets_dual.json` with a compatible library; no checksum sidecar or pinned data version is required.

### 🧠 LLM / VLM Analyze

The **DaSiWa LLM / VLM nodes** let you run local transformers chat or vision-language models from inside a ComfyUI workflow. They accept native `STRING` inputs and native `IMAGE` batches from nodes such as Load Image or VHS frame loaders.

- **Native ComfyUI Inputs:** Analyze connected text, still images, or video/image-sequence frame batches.
- **Prompt Presets:** Custom system instructions, LTX-2.3/Wan2.2 video prompt enhancement, and image/video caption presets for mixed tags, tag-only, or natural language.
- **Memory Modes:** Keep models cached for speed, or use full cleanup to unload DaSiWa and ComfyUI managed models before/after analysis so later image/video models recover VRAM/RAM.
- **Frame Sampling:** Limit video analysis with max frames, stride, frame strategy, resize controls, context limits, and optional KV-cache reduction.
- **Local, GGUF, or Loopback Ollama Models:** Load already-installed Transformers folders, local GGUF through llama.cpp, or call Ollama on `127.0.0.1`. Runtime model downloads, custom remote model code, and arbitrary Ollama URLs are disabled so a workflow cannot make the ComfyUI server fetch code or send requests to an attacker-chosen service.
