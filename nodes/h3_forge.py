"""MiniMax H3 Forge: write a Director prompt with a local LLM before the run.

The Forge button on the H3 Director opens an overlay; this module is the
server half. It runs outside the ComfyUI queue on purpose: the prompt is
written and reviewed first, the LLM is unloaded, and only then does the person
press Run. The LLM and the video model are never resident together.

The prompting is PromptForge's h3 prompting, exported by its
scripts/export-h3-forge.mjs into data/h3_forge.json. Every system prompt and
every ladder rule comes from that bundle; this file only assembles the user
message, calls the model, and splits its ===SEGMENT: output into the node's
builder fields. Prompt-only: no tool calls.

Models come from ComfyUI/models/llm (loaded in-process with nodes_llm.py's
loaders), an Ollama server, or an OpenAI-compatible server - see Backends.
